Task: How to check why an SQL query is slow

1. First, run the query manually and see if itâ€™s actually slow or if the app is slow for some other reason.

2. Use EXPLAIN to check how the DB is processing it.

Example:
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Books WHERE author_id = 2;

3. Look at output:
- Seq Scan = bad if you have a lot of rows
- Index Scan = good
- Cost = higher = slower

4. If there's no index, add one:
CREATE INDEX idx_author_id ON Books(author_id);

5. Run EXPLAIN again and see if it uses the index now.

6. Still slow? Try ANALYZE:
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM Books WHERE author_id = 2;

That actually runs the query and shows real times.

7. If the table is huge and always slow, maybe archive old rows or split into smaller tables.

Done.
